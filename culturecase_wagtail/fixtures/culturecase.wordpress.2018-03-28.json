It is also accompanied by a range of bibliographic data about the source material on which the summary was based. We expect most people to read the headline and the summary, but if you would like to investigate the study in more detail you can click through to the original academic paper (some of which are freely available online). When referring to information on this site it is best to link to the relevant entry in CultureCase, rather than the original academic paper itself. If you have read the paper yourself then please cite that reference directly.</p>\n<h2>A note of caution</h2>\n<p>Each of the research papers that make up this site has undergone a process of abstraction, that is to say they have been read and interpreted by us in order to draw out what we view are the most important and interesting findings.

The authors found that physical health was a key determinant of wellbeing. The only other statistically significant factor to affect wellbeing was cultural engagement. Wellbeing increased as a person engaged in more cultural activity but the effect tailed off with very high levels of engagement. The researchers used a variety of statistical techniques to tease out how various factors like health, cultural engagement and other demographic variables interact.

The authors took a range of data from surveys, box-office data, business databases and other methods to calculate the number of cultural assets within neighbourhoods in Philadelphia. They defined 'cultural assets' as: cultural participants; non-profit cultural providers, including unincorporated associations; commercial cultural firms; and resident artists.</p>\n<h2>The researchers gave each neighbourhood a cultural \u2018score\u2019</h2>\n<p>Taking all of these data together they calculated a single cultural score that related to the cultural activity within each neighbourhood in Philadelphia. They then looked at where within the city there were concentrations of cultural assets and how cultural asset scores corresponded with other measures associated with assessing the economic strength and health of places (such as neighbourhood desirability scores and property prices). Places with high concentrations of cultural assets were named 'cultural clusters' (which are 'cultivated not planned' and grow organically from within communities rather than centrally-planned 'cultural quarters' created by policymakers or developers).</p>\n<h2>They then looked at how culture affected these scores over time</h2>\n<p>When comparing data from the late 1990s to the early 2000s the authors found that 'cultural cluster' neighbourhoods saw higher levels of growth in affluence and desirability than other parts of Philadelphia.

They are cautious to point out that traditional types of economic impact (such as monetary spend, imports or employment) did not create this increase but rather suggest that cultural clusters are the sort of neighbourhoods with civically engaged residents and more sustainable and networked communities, which in turn make a place desirable to live in.</p>\n<h2>Something to keep in mind</h2>\n<p>The authors note that they are looking at impacts on neighbourhoods, and they cannot say whether increased affluence is as a result of poorer people being displaced by richer people, or poorer people becoming more affluent.</p>", "show_kcl_logo": false, "short_title": null}}, {"model": "culturecase_wagtail.richpage", "pk": 51, "fields": {"body": "<p>Here you'll find links to all the research in CultureCase, ordered under the themes below.</p>", "show_kcl_logo": false, "short_title": ""}}, {"model": "culturecase_wagtail.richpage", "pk": 52, "fields": {"body": "<p>[mc4wp_form]</p>", "show_kcl_logo": false, "short_title": null}}, {"model": "culturecase_wagtail.richpage", "pk": 53, "fields": {"body": "<p></p>", "show_kcl_logo": false, "short_title": null}}, {"model": "culturecase_wagtail.richpage", "pk": 54, "fields": {"body": "<p>This research was conducted by <strong>Eleanor D.

Results showed greater expression of positive emotions and increased levels of positive and negative emotion regulation in children attending the arts-enriched programme.

The longer the time lapse between the publication of hardcovers and paperback, the higher the sales figures for hardcover copies will be. The publication of a novel in its paperback version makes demand for hardcovers almost non-existent. Paperbacks novels without hardcover or e-book versions still sell steadily.</p>\n<h2>The battle between hardcovers and paperbacks is a matter of timing</h2>\n<p>Novels are a major genre in Japan, accounting for 40 per cent of total book sales. In Japan, books are first published as hardcovers followed by a paperback release approximately two years after their initial publication. This is a significant lag in comparison to the EU and US markets. In the Japanese market the release date of an e-book version is later than that of the paperback version. In the EU and US markets they usually appear with the publication of the hardcover.</p>\n<h2>The true costs of publishing</h2>\n<p>The researchers concluded that the costs of material production of a novel are linked to a number of variables. As there is no clear way of predicting the success of a book in terms of sales, book prices vary based on the number of pages (representing their manufacturing costs). Books previously released as hardcovers do not need further editing, thus reducing the costs of paperbacks. The introduction of e-books in Japan has not been as aggressive as in the US and the UK.

This means that the consumer essentially co-produces the art through their confrontation with it. Without an audience the work has no determined value. Therefore if one of the aims of the artistic (and arts marketing) process is to maximise the impact and value of that work amongst its audience then due regard needs to be given to how to maximize the audience experience in an \u2018artistic\u2019 sense.</p>\n<h2>What does this mean in practice?</h2>\n<p>The paper sets out the practicalities of marketing activity informed by aesthetic notions of relational value: the art needs to be shown in a context that maximises the artistic value of the work. So consumers should have their co-production role reinforced through the content and tone of marketing literature, or an interaction with the artist at some point in the production process. To maximize the conditions for artistic value, marketing activity should disrupt or provoke (rather than predictably reinforce). For art to really affect society a new (or relatively new) audience must be engaged.

All of this is informed by organisational analysis through audience research and evaluation, providing the museum with insights about attitudes and behaviours of museum visitors and non-visitors.

They cut back on staff, introduced (or increased) admission charges, and reduced their activities.</p>\n<h2>Voters in Denver needed convincing that a local tax would compensate for these cutbacks</h2>\n<p>The successful and energetic campaign for the tax emphasised the benefits of culture to children, the economy and the community. As a sales tax it would keep pace with inflation and spread the burden to visitors and tourists. There was a clear strategic policy driving the campaign and its administration, it garnered support from the general population (not just arts advocates) and from business.</p>\n<h2>Evidencing the local impact of arts and culture</h2>\n<p>The economic impact of the cultural organisations in Denver (as reported in a long-running assessment funded by a local lobby group) suggested that the economic impact generated by the arts had doubled in the 10 years after 1998 and outstripped the average economic performance of the city during this time of growth. Denver attracted more tourism than before, nearly double the number of overnight tourist trips to the city took place between 1991 and 2006, and with an increase in visitors the cultural organisations were able to leverage more funding from businesses, foundations and the public.</p>", "show_kcl_logo": false, "short_title": null}}, {"model": "culturecase_wagtail.richpage", "pk": 115, "fields": {"body": "<p>This research was conducted by\u00a0<strong>Leila Jancovich</strong> at <strong>Leeds Beckett University, UK</strong></p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This paper looked at ways in which participatory decision-making can bolster the links between arts organisations and their local audiences, particularly those not traditionally engaged in the arts.

This paper argues that the arts also play an integral role in fostering inclusive urban communities. Furthermore, that the centuries-old concept of the \u2018good city\u2019 should be revived to support the creative vibrancy of cities in the future.</p>\n<h2>Policymakers and scholars have long acknowledged the ability of the arts to bolster a city\u2019s economy</h2>\n<p>However, in the US policies aimed at securing affordable artistic spaces, for example, have been replaced by those that pursue more economically-minded interests such as increasing property values. As a result, creative spaces in modern cities are being squeezed out, weakening the \u2018creative\u2019 foundation of the \u2018creative city\u2019. In the face of these economic hardships, the authors argue that we need to re-evaluate the role of the arts in the modern city, suggesting that we turn to the seemingly antiquated concept of the \u2018good city\u2019 to do so.</p>\n<h2>The \u2018good city\u2019 was based on a synergy of art, design, and urban development</h2>\n<p>It was best exemplified by 15th-century Italian city-states that utilised museums and grand architecture to project state power while protecting the cultural values of the community. Though unintentional, the sense of heritage embodied by these cities gave rise to creative tourist economies and, later, academic conceptions of the \u2018creative city\u2019.</p>\n<h2>The notion of the \u2018good city\u2019 needs to be revisited and adapted for future creative city policy</h2>\n<p>Though the idea of the creative city has (unwittingly) informed modern ideas of arts-driven development, the authors conclude that the economic focus of contemporary policy has overshadowed the fundamental components of the good city that gave rise to the creative city in the first place. Urban policymakers and citizens alike must grapple with what \u2018citizenship\u2019, \u2018community\u2019, and \u2018heritage\u2019 mean for 21st-century cities.

This paper argues not, and that previous research is limited by its focus on prominent metro areas with pre-established cultural industries, places like New York or Los Angeles. The researchers analysed census data at a highly detailed geographic level to search for patterns across a wide array of US cities of varying sizes.

The arts, however, are not so well integrated into so-called \u2018innovation districts\u2019 (clusters of knowledge-based industries such as media, technology, and finance, in addition to nearby amenities such as cafes). On the neighbourhood level, the opposite is true: the arts do not drive neighbourhood-level economic growth, but they do cluster around innovation districts.</p>\n<h2>Policymakers need to think differently about neighbourhoods than they do about metro areas</h2>\n<p>Location patterns of arts clusters cannot be generalised because different cities have different arts industry strengths \u2013 such film in Los Angeles, or country music in Nashville. While artists seek out dense metro areas with diversity and amenities, they use a different set of criteria when choosing neighbourhoods to live and work in, selecting neighbourhoods that are attuned to, and beneficial for, their specific artistic industries.

In particular, participants developed a greater sense of agency and social capital.</p>\n<h2>The results are based on interviews with twelve people from Montreal, Canada who participated in community-based creative writing groups in 2011</h2>\n<p>The data came from poetry group participants, group facilitators and organization directors and volunteers. It involved five community-based creative writing groups based in food banks and drop-in centres. Four key categories of community development were explored in the study: capacity building (engaging the skills and capacities of participants); community building (an increase in identifying with a community); social capital (social networks of support); agency (ability to intervene in the world).</p>\n<h2>Poetry has much in common with other forms of art as a tool for community development</h2>\n<p>It was found that the act of creating, writing and sharing poetry with other members of the groups was seen as an act of empowerment, and therefore agency was one of the main benefits of these groups. Other benefits were experienced by participants, including an increased sense of self-esteem, increased leadership or group participation skills, and increased sense of community and proactive desire to participate in other community activities. Another suggested benefit was increased literary knowledge and communication skills, and for the facilitators an increased insight into poverty and mental health issues.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This summary is written by <strong>Charlotte Fereday, King\u2019s Knowledge Exchange Associate</strong></p>", "show_kcl_logo": false, "short_title": null}}, {"model": "culturecase_wagtail.richpage", "pk": 178, "fields": {"body": "<p>This research was conducted by <strong>Carl Grodach</strong> at the <strong>University of Texas at Arlington, USA</strong></p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This research explored the role of community arts spaces in providing public space and in this way supporting community development. It provides a comprehensive inventory of community art spaces (such as artist cooperatives, ethnic-specific art spaces and city-sponsored art centres) in the Dallas-Fort Worth region, the research showed that community art spaces play important roles related to community development, but that they also face challenges in fulfilling their potential. These challenges relate to their structures, programming, their buildings, and their location in the city.</p>\n<h2>Community arts spaces attract more diverse audiences than other art spaces</h2>\n<p>They can represent these diverse audiences through both programming and other activities, including those that are not related to art (such as community meetings). They provide increased opportunities for different community groups to engage with one another. They can provide a venue for making the work of under-represented groups (such as artists of colour) more visible. They also support artistic communities by providing peer support and networking opportunities.</p>\n<h2>Many factors may limit the ability of arts spaces to act as public spaces</h2>\n<p>These included having weak relationships with local communities, failing to turn diverse programming into diverse audiences, and physical issues, such as geographical location, accessibility, and being isolated due to building design. There are opportunities to increase the value of community arts spaces for community development through programming changes (e.g. joined-up scheduling of children and adult programmes) and through understanding visitor demographics. Physical changes (e.g. improving the outside of buildings with art, signage and landscaping, promoting public transport and placing new facilities where there is higher footfall) could also increase their potential.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This summary was written by <strong>Ruth Craggs, King\u2019s Knowledge Exchange Associate</strong></p>", "show_kcl_logo": false, "short_title": null}}, {"model": "culturecase_wagtail.richpage", "pk": 179, "fields": {"body": "<p>This research was conducted by <strong>Sabine Wollscheid</strong> at the <strong>Norwegian Knowledge Centre for the Health Services, Norway</strong></p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This paper explored the impact of parents\u2019 reading patterns on their children\u2019s reading habits.

The research rests on distinctions between these related and overlapping concepts. The author defines the terms as follows: social class describes one\u2019s position in the world (income, upbringing etc.); social status is a marker of one\u2019s lifestyle choices (including one\u2019s cultural habits); and education is measured through the highest formal qualification one holds.

Tests used to diagnose serious medical conditions often involve complex, intimidating technology, which may add to stress levels. Music has been used in a number of settings to help with stress reduction. In this study researchers from Hannover Medical School in Germany showed music to be beneficial in reducing patients\u2019 stress levels when undergoing cerebral angiography, where images are taken of blood vessels within the brain.</p>\n<h2>Music reduces blood pressure and prevents rises in stress hormones</h2>\n<p>This study observed 30 patients undergoing brain imaging for a variety of disorders (including brain tumours and bleeding within the brain). Half of them listened to music of their choice during the procedure. The other half did not listen to any music. Researchers examined personality traits related to anxiety at the outset and then measured fear ratings, blood pressure and stress hormones in the blood during the angiography itself. The music group showed lower blood pressure during the angiography, despite similar ratings for fear compared to the non-music group. A gradual increase in stress hormone level was seen in the control group but not in those who listened to music.</p>\n<h2>Music helps people relax and distracts them</h2>\n<p>The researchers conclude that music appears to help mitigate the stress response that naturally occurs in a highly medical, frightening situation. This is in agreement with previous research undertaken in other medical and surgical settings, including intensive care. The benefits were greatest in the subjects who reported higher anxiety at the start of the study. Patients reported that they felt the music helped them relax and focus less on their circumstances, though the researchers note that the full mechanisms underlying the effects of music on the human body remain to be determined.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This summary is by<strong> Vicky MacBean, King\u2019s Knowledge </strong><strong>Exchange</strong><strong> Associate</strong></p>", "show_kcl_logo": false, "short_title": null}}, {"model": "culturecase_wagtail.richpage", "pk": 194, "fields": {"body": "<p>This research was conducted by <strong>E.

Scores in vocabulary and emotion comprehension were not affected by participation in the music classes for either low or high performers. Pupils with initial low scores on sympathy and pro-social behaviour performed better at the end of the year in those domains if they had participated in the music classes.

Consequently, researchers in Australia decided to explore the benefits of attending a community choir for a group of 20 participants living with aphasia following a stroke. Aphasia (the inability to understand or express speech) is a common consequence of suffering a stroke. The choir was led by a neurological music therapist, and assisted by volunteers. Over 12 weeks the choir prepared material for a concert for family and friends.

There is evidence people with aphasia retain the ability to sing.

However, the rate of decline of concert frequency is quite slow, and low in absolute terms: if a facility hosted nine concerts in its first year, between years ten and fifteen it is likely to host between six and seven a year.

The author questions how sustainable this process is and suggests that in future the emphasis should change to make improvements to the working lives of local artists.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This summary is by <strong>Elena Popa, King\u2019s Knowledge Exchange Associate</strong></p>", "show_kcl_logo": false, "short_title": null}}, {"model": "culturecase_wagtail.richpage", "pk": 209, "fields": {"body": "<p>This research was conducted by <strong>Betty A.

The important determinants of couples\u2019 arts engagement \u2013 either separately or together \u2013 included level of education, employment, and health. The education level of women was particularly significant, with well-educated women having a strong, positive influence over the couples\u2019 engagement with the arts.

Based on interviews at Penguin Books, analyses of press coverage of the novel, as well as charting <em>White Teeth</em>\u2019s swift absorption into the academic canon of English literature (for instance in scholarly literature and school syllabi), the author argues that Penguin\u2019s marketing strategy was crucial in resolving this apparent contradiction between critical and mass appeal.</p>\n<h2>The secret of <em>White Teeth</em>\u2019s double success was based on acknowledging and embracing the tension between critical and commercial success</h2>\n<p>Even at the acquisition stage, the manuscript of <em>White Teeth</em> was acknowledged by its editor to possess literary and commercial appeals. This was in part due to inherent qualities in the book\u2019s writing \u2013 such as the many witty references to British and American popular culture.

Penguin aimed to balance the potentially devaluing effects of the media hype and marketing on the book\u2019s literary cache by purposefully building up the persona of an author striving to create a long-term literary work recognised by peers.

The aim of this study was to understand its role. So far experts have focused mainly on other factors like education, vicinity to museum location, wealth, time constraints, whose effects are also confirmed to be significant in this study. The research identified two principal characteristics of motivation: recreational and intellectual.</p>\n<h2>The research surveyed visitors to Vittoriale</h2>\n<p>Vittoriale is a popular museum on the shores of Lake Garda in Italy. During summer 2012, the researchers carried out a survey of visitors asking about the reasons for visiting this destination. They subsequently divided the answers into six main categories: curiosity; specific or professional interest; learning something new; spend free time/relax; visit cultural attractions; accompany friends/relatives. They regarded motivations to visit Vittoriale as broadly representative of motivations to visit any museum. Using statistical analysis, the researchers conclude that motivation plays a driving role in understanding museum visiting, provided that other socio-economic factors are taken into account.</p>\n<h2>The research identified two principal characteristics of motivation</h2>\n<p>These mark distinct attitudes towards cultural consumption. The first is a recreational attitude, which envisions museums as a form of light entertainment, the second is more intellectual and sustained by genuine search for knowledge. In the case of recreational motivation, the attendance is occasional, limited to holidays, but constant over years: typically it is aimed at making best use of the large amount of leisure time during holidays when they lack other entertainments or to comply with \u201cmust-do\u201d lists suggested by tourist guides and other travelers. A recreational attitude is associated with a low frequency of museum attendance more generally. This evidence can open new perspectives on museum policy, such as opening hours and additional services to ensure a satisfying experience for these occasional visitors.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This summary is by <strong>Barbara Bravi, King\u2019s Knowledge Exchange Associate</strong></p>", "show_kcl_logo": false, "short_title": null}}, {"model": "culturecase_wagtail.richpage", "pk": 215, "fields": {"body": "<p>This research was conducted by <strong>Jessica E.

For example, if theatre-goers are fully rational (as this paper suggests), government could influence theatre attendance by different policy tools, such as ticket prices, and so reduce or increase the level of public expenditure, but all efforts need to be based on an understanding of the 'rational addiction' model of human behaviour.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This summary is by <strong>Barbara Bravi, King\u2019s Knowledge Exchange Associate</strong></p>", "show_kcl_logo": false, "short_title": null}}, {"model": "culturecase_wagtail.richpage", "pk": 217, "fields": {"body": "<p>This research was conducted by <strong>Ben Walmsley</strong> at the <strong>University of Leeds, UK</strong></p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This article presents findings from an in-depth project carried out with five audience-participants at cultural events during Leeds\u2019 annual LoveArts festival.

It finds that streaming gives more people a way to experience theatre and opera, although that experience is different to live performance, and does not necessary diversify audiences.</p>\n<h2>Streaming provides a significantly different aesthetic experience from a live performance on stage</h2>\n<p>Sitting in the dark, the use of a musical score and close ups of a particular character enables cinema audiences to become emotionally engaged in a performance. Theatregoers can be rather more detached, choosing for themselves where to look, and engaging in a \u2018suspension of disbelief\u2019. The cinema experience can lack the type of involvement that could lead to spontaneous applause and the sense of a shared occasion with others in person.</p>\n<h2>Streaming audiences are similar to live theatre and opera audiences</h2>\n<p>Those who see performances in the cinema are both socio-demographically and culturally more similar to theatre audiences than to typical cinema audiences. Conceivably, streaming might reduce the size of the market for theatre and opera, as audiences who would have seen the live show simply opt for the (cheaper) streamed performance instead. However, there is no sign that this has happened in the UK.</p>\n<h2>Streaming live performances enables more taxpayers to benefit from public funding for theatre and opera</h2>\n<p>Although data suggests ticket prices affect the decision to attend a streamed (rather than live) performance, price seems to be less important than other factors, such as traveling distance and parking facilities at venues.

Another claims that cultural activities are more rewarding to individuals who are better able to process complex information (cognitive ability). This study found that both cognitive ability and status affect the role of education in cultural engagement, and that this differs according to local context.</p>\n<h2>Many different factors affect engagement in cultural activities</h2>\n<p>Data from the International Adult Literacy Survey in 1994 and 1998 covering 18 countries was subjected to a series of statistical analyses. Respondents were aged 26 and older. \u2018High brow\u2019 cultural engagement was defined as attending cultural performances (movies, plays or concerts) and frequency of reading books. Higher levels of education and literacy (cognitive ability) were strongly associated with increased levels of cultural engagement. Parental educational level, being younger (aged 26\u201335) and being female were also highly predictive of engaging in cultural activities.</p>\n<h2>Status-related effect of education varies across countries</h2>\n<p>Status had less of an effect on cultural participation in societies that had large proportions of highly educated people (i.e. there was less educational inequality). The same was also true for societies with more educational mobility \u2013 as indicated by differences between the level of educational attainment for parents and children. This indicates that status incentives are reduced for cultural engagement in more equal societies. The authors suggest that reducing educational inequality may result in less in inequality in other areas. On the other hand, the relationship between a person\u2019s literacy skills (cognitive ability) and cultural engagement did not change according to their native country\u2019s level of educational inequality, suggesting that cognitive ability is not affected by social context.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This summary is by <strong>Tanya</strong><strong> Graham, King\u2019s Knowledge Exchange Associate</strong></p>", "show_kcl_logo": false, "short_title": null}}, {"model": "culturecase_wagtail.richpage", "pk": 240, "fields": {"body": "<p>This research was conducted by <strong>Mart Willekens</strong> and <strong>John Lievens</strong> at <strong>Ghent University, Belgium</strong></p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>This paper assesses the role of cultural capital, economic and social factors and time pressure on engaging in arts and heritage activities.

The final data set consists of around 2,500 Flemish nationals aged between 14 and 85 who were asked about their engagement in cultural activities in the previous six months.</p>\n<h2>Approximately one third of people do not participate in arts and heritage activities</h2>\n<p>The social distinction obtained as a result of cultural engagement by parents is partially inherited by their children. On the other hand, a lack of economic capital (cash, income, assets etc.) does not seem to prevent engagement, so the problem of non-attendance might not be explained by high ticket prices.</p>\n<h2>Having a full-time job does not lower people's frequency of attendance</h2>\n<p>One might imagine that having a full-time job would generate time constrains and therefore lower the likelihood of attendees working full-time (compared to those working part-time), however the statistical model developed in the paper shows that in the majority of cases a part-time job decreases the frequency of arts and heritage attendance.</p>\n<h2>Having children negatively impacts engagement in arts and heritage activities for women more than men</h2>\n<p>Having a child diminishes the likelihood of engagement for all parents, but affects women to a greater degree due to fathers tending to shoulder fewer parental duties than mothers.

Listeners and Players resemble each other, they both describe the process of \u2018getting into\u2019 country as \u2018working their way\u2019 to it via other genres. Listeners are most likely to have cultural roots in the South. Players develop their appreciation by learning to play it, they describe this as \u2018imitation\u2019. For Dancers it is about interpreting the music. Their experience is deeply embodied and holistic and the dancing takes time to learn. Dancers experience a conversion: for example one dancer started as a fan of rockabilly and swing prior to becoming a Honky Tonk regular.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This summary is by\u00a0<strong>Sheridan Humphreys, King\u2019s Knowledge Exchange Associate</strong></p>", "show_kcl_logo": false, "short_title": null}}, {"model": "culturecase_wagtail.richpage", "pk": 256, "fields": {"body": "<p>This research was conducted by <strong>David Gerry, Andrea Unrau</strong> and <strong>Laurel J.

This study investigates the perceptions and reactions of nine such individuals at three different orchestral concerts, with music ranging from well-known to previously unheard classical pieces.

The process of appreciating classical music is gradual and is not simply a consequence of being culturally active.</p>\n<h2>Other audience members' enthusiasm made new attendees feel like outsiders</h2>\n<p>'Lack of knowledge' was a key factor that influenced the feeling of being morally obliged to like the music being performed.
